## Authorization
Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to information
security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is
to define an access policy.

## Authentication
Authentication is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system userModel.
In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is 
the process of verifying that identity.

## Install
